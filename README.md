OpenAPI MCP is an open-source framework for exposing any [OpenAPI][1]-documented HTTP APIs as [MCP][2] servers. Built
on [Spring AI][3] and designed to run as a [Spring Boot][4] application, it's already running in production,
powering [Infobip MCP servers][5].

It's production-tested and ready for you to use in your own projects!

## Features

The framework is a bridge from the OpenAPI described APIs to MCP servers. Core functionality is mapping HTTP API
operations (paths and HTTP methods) to MCP tools. This includes a setup step that happens upfront to prepare tool
metadata which is presented to AI agents and a runtime step that happens when AI agents invoke tools.

Some of the core features include:

- Adapting OpenAPI specification to work with MCP tools. APIs have more flexibility in their inputs, e.g. they accept
  path and query parameters, while MCP tools expect to receive all inputs as a single JSON object. The framework will
  detect these cases and wrap / unwrap inputs accordingly.
- OpenAPI specification allows advanced features in request schema definitions, such as discriminators for polymorphic
  models. This is not allowed in pure JSON schema used by MCP, so the framework has a transformation step in which
  discriminators are resolved and embedded in a way compatible with JSON schema.
- Mock mode in which MCP server returns examples from the OpenAPI specification instead of making HTTP API calls

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The OpenAPI MCP framework allows you to expose any HTTP API documented with OpenAPI to LLM agents. Since LLMs will
> process the API responses it is important that you trust the API won't compromise your users' agents with prompt
> injections. It is equally important to trust the OpenAPI specification, as it is used as a source of meta-data that is
> directly provided to LLMs. When exposing your own APIs make sure that responses are secure and can't be used to inject
> untrusted text that might contain prompt injection. When exposing 3rd party APIs make sure the API itself is trusted,
> but also that the OpenAPI specification which defines it is equally trusted. When working with 3rd party OpenAPI
> specifications you can review and store them as a static files inside your application resources. That way you can be
> sure specifications won't change unexpectedly.

### Authentication

Authentication and authorization is important for MCP servers, and can be tricky to implement. In case of exposing HTTP
APIs as MCP tools the security posture of the API is bases for everything. The OpenAPI MCP framework adapts it to MCP
specification in few key ways:

- The framework exposes required `/.well-known` HTTP endpoints. Two of them (`/.well-known/openid-configuration` and
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) are proxied to your [authorization server][5], and one (the
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`) is handled by the framework itself.
- There is the option of supporting authorization checking API endpoint that framework invokes before processing MCP
  interactions to validate client credentials.

Lastly, by delegating authentication to dedicated API endpoint, the framework supports arbitrary auth type, such as
classic API key and Basic auth types, in addition to OAuth.

There are more technical features that enable customizing various behaviors, like:

- OpenAPI filters that can be used to programmatically customize the specification before MCP tool metadata is
  constructed.
- [OpenAPI extensions][7] that can be used to customize different aspects of MCP tools, including listing custom OAuth
  scopes.
- Several naming strategies are available to customize MCP tool names.
- API request enrichers that can be used to programmatically customize the API requests that back the tool calls.
- MCP tool call filters that can be used to customize tool call behavior.
- A base of [Spring AI][3] external customization options, which framework builds on top of with its own options. See
  below for a full list.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

OpenAPI MCP framework requires Java version 21 of newer, and is based on [Spring Boot][4] `3.5.x` and [Spring AI][3]
`1.1.x`.

### Installation

You can install it in your Java project with maven:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.infobip.openapi.mcp</groupId>
    <artifactId>infobip-openapi-mcp-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.13</version>
</dependency>
```

or gradle:

```groovy
implementation("com.infobip.openapi.mcp:infobip-openapi-mcp-spring-boot-starter:0.1.13")
```

## Usage

After installation enable one of the [server protocols supported by Spring AI][8] with externalized configuration
properties. For example, you can enable [stdio transport][9] with a config like this:

```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    mcp:
      server:
        type: sync
        stdio: on
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to set the server type to `sync`, as some of the framework features (such as authentication) will not work
> with the `async` type.

To expose a remote server using the currently recommended [streamable HTTP transport][10] use this config:

```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    mcp:
      server:
        protocol: STATELESS
```

## Configuration

### OpenApiFilter

You can implement and register beans of type `com.infobip.openapi.mcp.openapi.filter.OpenApiFilter` to change the
OpenAPI specification before framework extracts MCP tool meta-data from it. Individual filters can be disabled in
externalized configuration with the `infobip.openapi.mcp.filters.[filter-name]` property. For example, to disable the
built-in filter that removes regex pattern property from OpenAPI schemas set
`infobip.openapi.mcp.filters.PatternPropertyRemover: false`.

> [!TIP]
> AI agents perform best with smaller, focused MCP servers. On the contrast, HTTP APIs are ofter large and full of
> different features. This means we usually need to pick a subset of API operations that will be included as tools.
> Sometimes we need to also pick a limited subset of input parameters like query parameters or even request body
> properties. There are two ways to prepare OpenAPI specification for this:
>
> 1. You can make a dedicated OpenAPI specification for your MCP servers. This can be done either from scratch, or by
     transforming the original specification with something like [OpenAPI overlays][12]. This transformation can be
     automated as part of your CI pipeline. In this case your MCP server will receive the limited-scope specification
     with only the elements that you selected to expose to AI agents.
> 2. Alternatively, you can provide MCP server with the original, fully featured specification and narrow down its scope
     by implementing OpenAPI filters in your application code.
>
> Both approaches can be combined.

### Tool NamingStrategy

MCP servers expose functionalities to AI agents as tools. Each tool is identified by a name which is accompanied by a
description. LLMs pick tools to use based on this information, so it is important to make them concise and clear. The
framework implements several strategies for naming tools:

1. `OperationIdStrategy`, which produces names based on `operationId` from OpenAPI specification.
2. `SanitizedOperationIdStrategy` which uses `operationId`, but sanitizes it by lowercasing alphanumeric characters and
   replacing others with underscore.
3. `EndpointStrategy`, which combines HTTP method and path.

Various MCP client libraries have different limitations on the maximum tool name length. To accommodate this the
framework provides `TrimNamingStrategy`, which wraps one of the base strategies and enforces length limits on top of it.

You can customize tool naming with `infobip.openapi.mcp.tools.naming.strategy` and
`infobip.openapi.mcp.tools.naming.max-length` external configuration properties. If provided implementations do not meet
your needs you can provide your own implementation.

> [!TIP]
> Many MCP client libraries implement scoping of tool names. Common pattern is to allow client applications to name each
> MCP server they connect to, and to prepend the server name to names of tools loaded from the server. This means you as
> MCP server developer do not need to scope your tool names. It is best to keep names short and to the point.

### Tool descriptions

LLMs pick tools based on their names and descriptions. In order for them to be able to do that descriptions of all tools
from all MCP servers that an agent is connected to are loaded into LLM context. This means that tool descriptions need
to be as short as possible while retaining clarity, but not shorter than that.

The OpenAPI MCP framework can use few API operation properties to create tool descriptions. It can either take just the
operation summary, or it can combine it with operation description. The behavior can be controlled with
`infobip.openapi.mcp.tools.prepend-summary-to-description` externalized configuration property.

The framework can also append a request example to each tool description as a Markdown JSON code block. Examples are
extracted from the OpenAPI specification — from parameters and request bodies — and combined into a single object
mirroring the tool's input schema structure. The behavior is controlled by the
`infobip.openapi.mcp.tools.examples-mode` property, which accepts three values:

- `SKIP` (default) — no examples are appended.
- `ALL` — all examples from the OpenAPI specification are included.
- `ANNOTATED` — only examples explicitly marked for MCP use are included. Mark an example by adding
  `x-mcp-example: true` directly on the OpenAPI `Example` Object (inside the `examples` map of a parameter or request
  body):

  ```yaml
  examples:
    basicRequest:
      summary: Basic SMS
      x-mcp-example: true
      value:
        to: "41793026727"
        text: "Hello"
    advancedRequest:
      summary: Advanced SMS (not shown in MCP)
      value:
        to: "41793026727"
        text: "Hello"
        validityPeriod: 720
  ```

> [!TIP] Be mindful that examples add to the context size consumed by tool descriptions. If the examples in your OpenAPI
> specification are large or numerous, `ANNOTATED` mode is the recommended approach — it lets you selectively expose
> only the examples that are most useful for the LLM, without needing OpenAPI overlays or custom filters.

### Tool annotations

MCP tools support [annotations][15] that describe their behavior to MCP clients. The framework automatically infers
annotations from the HTTP method of each API operation:

| HTTP Method        | `readOnlyHint` | `destructiveHint` | `idempotentHint` | `openWorldHint` |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| GET, HEAD, OPTIONS | `true`         | `false`            | `true`            | `true`          |
| PUT                | `false`        | `false`            | `true`            | `true`          |
| POST               | `false`        | `false`            | `false`           | `true`          |
| DELETE             | `false`        | `true`             | `true`            | `true`          |
| PATCH              | `false`        | `false`            | `false`           | `true`          |

`openWorldHint` is always `true` because every tool calls an external HTTP API.

Annotations can be overridden per-operation using the `x-mcp-annotations` [vendor extension][7] on the OpenAPI
Operation object:

```yaml
paths:
  /messages:
    post:
      operationId: sendMessage
      x-mcp-annotations:
        idempotentHint: true
```

They can also be overridden globally per tool name using externalized configuration properties:

```yaml
infobip:
  openapi:
    mcp:
      tools:
        annotations:
          sendMessage:
            idempotent-hint: true
```

Override precedence (lowest to highest): HTTP method defaults, `x-mcp-annotations` vendor extension, YAML configuration
properties. Each layer only overrides fields it explicitly sets; unset fields fall through from the previous layer.

### Authentication

MCP defines OAuth as preferred authentication method. The framework aims to make this as easy to implement as possible.
There are few considerations when exposing existing APIs:

1. The underlying API must implement the same authentication type as MCP server.
2. There are few specifics of MCP specification that need to be satisfied for clients to work automatically.

One of MCP requirements is that first interaction with MCP server that doesn't include valid credentials should be
rejected; in fact that is what triggers the login flow in MCP clients. However, this interaction is usually not direct
tool invocation, meaning that the framework does not need to make any API calls to implement tool calls. Since
credentials still need to be verified framework needs to invoke some API endpoint which only performs the
authentication. This special endpoint, which is not exposed as a tool but is used only in this auth flow, needs to be
defined in an externalized configuration property `infobip.openapi.mcp.security.auth.auth-url`. This is needed whenever
security is enabled. The framework will pass any `Authorization` header from the inbound MCP request to the `auth-url`
endpoint on the API.

#### OAuth

MCP specification defines a flow for automatic [authorization server discovery][13]. One of the requirements is that MCP
server itself should expose few `/.well-known` HTTP endpoints defined by the OAuth specification. Some of these are
usually implemented by the OAuth authorization server, and the OpenAPI MCP framework can proxy those calls to make it
more convenient to expose them from the same server as the rest of MCP features. Some endpoints are implemented and
exposed directly by the framework, as in acts as OAuth resource server.

OAuth APIs usually rely on scopes for fine-grained access control, and MCP specification allows for this. OpenAPI MCP
framework takes the OAUth scope information from the provided OpenAPI specification. The framework looks for scopes
either in standard security properties or in custom operation-level OpenAPI extensions that can be defined in
`infobip.openapi.mcp.security.auth.oauth.scope-discovery.scope-extensions`. Additionally, fixed, predefined scopes can
also be defined with `infobip.openapi.mcp.security.auth.oauth.scope-discovery.mandatory-scopes`.

You can configure what set from all discovered scopes are requested during login by setting the externalized
configuration property `infobip.openapi.mcp.security.auth.oauth.scope-discovery.calculate-minimal-scopes`. When `NONE`
is used, which is the default, all discovered scopes are requested. When `GREEDY` is used an optimistic greedy algorithm
picks a subset of scopes which still covers all operations.

### ApiRequestEnricher

If you need to customize HTTP requests that the framework is making towards the API you can implement and register beans
of type `com.infobip.openapi.mcp.enricher.ApiRequestEnricher`. This is a good place to include any meta-data for
monitoring or custom tracing that you may need. Framework provides few enrichers out of the box, for example the one
that sets the `User-Agent` header to the value defined in externalized configuration property
`infobip.openapi.mcp.user-agent`.

> [!NOTE]
> Implementations of API request enrichers should be lightweight and non-critical. The framework will skip enrichers
> that fail by catching any exceptions and carry on to make the API request. This is why the enricher interface is
> limited
> to tweaking Spring's `RestClient.RequestHeadersSpec` and does not provide options to break the flow and prevent the
> API
> call from being made.

### CredentialProvider

The framework uses `com.infobip.openapi.mcp.auth.CredentialProvider` to obtain the credential
value used for authenticating incoming requests and forwarding authorization to the downstream API.
The default implementation reads the `Authorization` header from the incoming HTTP request.

You can replace this bean to supply credentials from any source:

```java
@Bean
public CredentialProvider credentialProvider() {
    return context -> Optional.of(myVaultClient.getApiKey())
            .filter(key -> !key.isBlank())
            .map(key -> "Bearer " + key);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the provider throws an unchecked exception, the framework catches it and fails closed:
> `InitialAuthenticationFilter` returns HTTP 401, and `ToolHandler` returns an error tool result
> with an authentication error.

### ToolCallFilter

You can implement and register beans of type `com.infobip.openapi.mcp.openapi.tool.ToolCallFilter` to customize the tool
call handling behavior. Tool call filters can modify requests before making API calls, as well as API responses before
returning them to MCP client. They are also a good place to implement custom observability. Unlike API request
enrichers, tool call filters can break the processing chain, thus preventing the API call from being made.

The `com.infobip.openapi.mcp.openapi.tool.RegisteredTool` provides the default implementation of a tool filter which
makes the HTTP API call. It is registered with the lowest precedence, so you can preempt it by using any precedence
higher than that.

### JSON serialization

Both MCP client libraries and underlying LLMs can sometimes produce invalid JSON documents and send them to MCP server
tools. The OpenAPI MCP framework implements a helper to address one of the common errors: embedding JSON sub-objects
into strings. This is a common failure mode in which a sub-object property of a complex request model is sent to MCP
server inside a JSON string. The framework will first send this request to HTTP API as normal, but will likely receive a
HTTP status code `400` response. In that case framework will attempt to unwrap string property values and look for a
JSON object or a JSON array inside it. If it detects such a case, it sends another HTTP API requests with the corrected
request body.

You can disable this behavior by setting externalized configuration property
`infobip.openapi.mcp.tools.json-double-serialization-mitigation: false`.

### Mock mode

Framework offers a mock mode in which MCP server will return tool call results based on examples from the OpenAPI
specification. Framework picks first example for the successful (2xx range) response with `application/json` content
type from the API endpoint that corresponds to the tool being called. In case example is missing for the specific
API endpoint an error MCP result is returned. This feature is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the
externalized configuration property `infobip.openapi.mcp.tools.mock: true`.

> [!NOTE]
> Even with mock mode enabled, security features still work and will delegate authentication checks to the server
> defined by the `infobip.openapi.mcp.security.auth.auth-url` property. This allows MCP client implementors to test
> authentication configuration on their end, including OAuth config.
>
> If this is not desired you can disable authentication by setting `infobip.openapi.mcp.security.auth.enabled: false`.
> By disabling auth and enabling mock mode framework won't use API, and all tool calls will receive successful results
> based on OpenAPI examples.

### Tool Reload

The framework supports automatic reloading of the OpenAPI specification at runtime. When enabled, the framework
periodically fetches the OpenAPI specification and updates the registered MCP tools if changes are detected. This is
useful for scenarios where the OpenAPI specification is updated frequently and you want the MCP server to reflect these
changes without requiring a restart.

Tool reload works by comparing the OpenAPI specification version. When a version change is detected, the framework
compares the registered tools with the new specification and:

- Removes tools that no longer exist in the specification
- Adds new tools that were introduced in the specification
- Updates tools that have changed (title, description, or schema)
- Discovers new OAuth scopes if scope discovery is enabled

After detecting changes, connected MCP clients are notified about the tool list changes, and OAuth scopes are
rediscovered automatically if scope discovery is enabled.
> [!NOTE]
> Due to MCP SDK constraints, notifications are sent after each individual tool modification rather than in batch.

The framework retries up to `max-retries` times per scheduled execution, but terminates early on the first successful
reload (whether or not tools changed). Retries only occur when the reload fails (e.g., due to network errors), using
exponential backoff between attempts. If a refresh is already in progress when the next scheduled execution triggers,
that execution is skipped.

**Prerequisites:**

- Add `@EnableScheduling` to your Spring Boot application configuration

**Configuration example:**

```yaml
infobip:
  openapi:
    mcp:
      live-reload:
        enabled: true
        cron-expression: "0 */5 * * * *"  # Every 5 minutes
        max-retries: 3
```

> [!WARNING]
> The tool reload task runs on Spring's task scheduler thread pool and blocks the thread during execution. By default,
> Spring uses a single-threaded scheduler. If your application has multiple scheduled tasks and the reload operation
> takes time (e.g., due to network latency), consider configuring a larger thread pool:
> ```yaml
> spring:
>   task:
>     scheduling:
>       pool:
>         size: 2
> ```
